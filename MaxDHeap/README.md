# MaxDHeap
A simple, non-generic and minimalist implementation of the heap sort algorithm
using d-ary maximum heap, to sort an array of integers.

"A d-ary heap is like a binary heap, but (with one possible exception) non-leaf
nodes have d children instead of 2 children." (problem 4.2, "Introduction to Algorithms",
by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.
